Music Player

This application is built completly using python and its required modules.
Here, a native player interface is dsigned using python GUI module, to control the music. 
It makes sure to search through the complete drive space mentioned in the code(default drive D: ).

It will create a list of all .mp3 and .waw files (standerd music files) and provide it to us as a playlist.

All the user has to do is to run play, pause, select next song and go on and on.

Happy Listning!!
